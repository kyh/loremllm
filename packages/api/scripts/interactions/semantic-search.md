# Semantic Search in LoremLLM

Our smart matching uses **semantic search** to find the best response for user queries:

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Embedding Generation**
   - When you create an interaction, we generate an embedding (vector) of the input
   - Embeddings capture the *meaning* of text, not just keywords

2. **Similarity Matching**
   - When a user query comes in, we generate its embedding
   - We compare it against all interaction embeddings in your collection
   - The closest match is returned as the response

3. **Intelligent Fallbacks**
   - If no close match is found, you can set a default response
   - Configurable similarity threshold

## âœ¨ Benefits

**Handles Variations:**
```
Input: "What is LoremLLM?"
Also matches:
- "Tell me about LoremLLM"
- "Explain what LoremLLM does"
- "What's this platform for?"
```

**Different Phrasing:**
```
Input: "How much does it cost?"
Also matches:
- "What's the pricing?"
- "How expensive is this?"
- "Tell me about your plans"
```

No need to create interactions for every possible variation!
