**LoremLLM** is a platform that helps developers create and manage mock LLM (Large Language Model) endpoints for testing and development purposes.

Think of it as "Lorem Ipsum" but for AI responses! Instead of using expensive real AI calls during development, you can:

- âœ¨ Create collections of mock interactions
- ðŸŽ¯ Define specific input/output pairs
- ðŸ”„ Use semantic search to match similar queries
- ðŸš€ Deploy endpoints that mimic real LLM behavior
- ðŸ’° Save costs during development and testing

It's perfect for prototyping AI features, testing edge cases, and building demos without worrying about API costs or rate limits!
