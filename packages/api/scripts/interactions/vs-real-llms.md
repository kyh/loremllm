# LoremLLM vs Real LLM APIs

LoremLLM and real LLMs serve different purposes! Here's when to use each:

## ðŸŽ¯ Use LoremLLM When:

- **Development/Prototyping:** Building UI before backend is ready
- **Testing:** Need predictable, consistent responses for tests
- **Demos:** Want to control exactly what's shown
- **Learning:** Teaching concepts without API costs
- **High Volume:** Serving thousands of similar queries efficiently
- **Offline:** Need to work without internet/API access
- **Cost Sensitive:** Want to minimize API costs during development

## ðŸ¤– Use Real LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) When:

- **Production:** Serving real users with dynamic queries
- **Creativity:** Need novel, generated responses
- **Flexibility:** Can't predict all possible user inputs
- **Complex Reasoning:** Need true understanding and reasoning
- **Dynamic Content:** Responses depend on real-time data

## ðŸŽ¨ Best Practice: Use Both!

```typescript
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

const model = isDevelopment 
  ? loremllmModel  // Fast, free, predictable
  : openaiModel;   // Smart, dynamic, production-ready
```

**Pro tip:** Start with LoremLLM for development, then gradually introduce real LLMs as you validate your use case!
